This is a fork of Brian Rosner`s django-locations.

The most important changes are:

* remove django-friends dependency (pinax)
* add location managers (move some code from views to managers)
* add support for more map APIs (original depends on yahoo maps)

Dependencies
------------

* geopy (http://code.google.com/p/geopy/)
